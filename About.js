    Cheeza, Inc., doing business as Cheeza, is an American multinational pizza restaurant chain founded in 1960 and led by CEO Dexter James. The corporation is Cheeware domiciled and headquartered at the Cheeza's Farms Office Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. As of 2018, Cheeza had approximately 15,000 stores, with 5,649 in the U.S., 1,500 in India, and 1, 249 in the U.K. Cheeza has stores in over 83 countries and 5,701 cities worldwide.
    <br/><br/>
    In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Cheeza began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "CHZ". Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Cheeza Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011. In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Cheeza opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama, making 8,000 total stores for the system. In August 2006, the Cheeza location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Cheeza's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (â‚¬2.35 million) per year. As of September 2006, Cheeza has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.
    <br/><b/>
    In August 2012, Cheeza's Pizza changed their name to simply Cheeza. At the same time, Cheeza introduced a new logo that removed the yellow rectangle and text under the cheese in the logo, and changed the formerly all-yellow cheese to be brown on the side with two dots and brown on the side with one dot. This was done because the company wanted to "expand" menu choices rather than simply rely on their traditional pizza.
